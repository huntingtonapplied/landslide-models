# landslide-models

Runnable neural-surrogate inference package for **landslide** — compiled and torch-free (ONNX + `onnxruntime`, CPU). Physical spec in, physical results out.

```python
from landslide_models import load, list_models
model = load(list_models()[0])
```

## Install

Preview packages are proprietary and are **not on PyPI**, so `pip install landslide-models` will not resolve. Install the wheel directly from the GitHub release:

```
pip install https://github.com/huntingtonapplied/landslide-models/releases/download/v0.2.1/landslide_models-0.2.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

Dependencies: `numpy`, `onnxruntime` (CPU) — no torch. A hosted package index (so `pip install landslide-models` resolves directly) is planned.
